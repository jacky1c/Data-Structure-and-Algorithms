-> "Report with Test Input.txt"
	is the report I got using KnuthMorrisPratt algorithm
	text files are "NoPattern.txt", "PatternAtBeginning.txt", "PatternInMiddle.txt", "PatternInMiddle2.txt", and  "MultiplePattern.txt"
	pattern file is "TestPattern.txt"
	this report should answer question 2(a)
-> "BoyerMooreReport.txt", "BruteForceReport.txt", and "KnuthMorrisPrattReport.txt"
	are reports I got using "text.txt" and "patterns.txt" as input
	run the program 3 times, each time with one pattern matching algorithm
	those 3 reports should answer question 2(b)
